changeMemcachedInstanceTypes.php
This script converts the instance type on running instance types.  It does so by
having extra stopped EC2 instances.  The running and stopped instances are
swapped.  Data is preserved on the session servers, but not the data servers.

changeWebServerInstanceTypes.php
This is a simple script to quickly do a mass change of instance types on all
stopped web server instances.
