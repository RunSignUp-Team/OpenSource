This folder contains pieces of code used to load test a website. Some files are
complete files whereas others are just code snippets.

ServerManager.class.php
This file contains functions to manage servers in the infrastructure. Some
portions of this file are specific to RunSignUp, such as getting the proper web
server image or getting web server instances, but can be easily updated for
other infrastructures. This file includes a method that starts new web servers,
evenly distributing them across EC2 Azailability Zones. It also can start spot
instances to serve as test servers.

runLoadTest.php
This is an example file that runs a load test. It runs in the background to
start test servers, do initial setup, collect and report stats while the test is
running, and clean up the test. This file will not run as-is. It contains a lot
of RunSignUp specific code, but can be a good starting point for other
applications. It starts test servers to run the test and has the basic flow of
running a load test.

LoadTestingPageResponse.class.php
This file is used to parse HTML responses and provides utility functions.

LoadTestingSession.class.php
This file simulates a session on a web site.  It includes a utility function to
simulate filling in form fields.

LoadTestingTest.class.php
This is an abstract class that load tests should be based off of.  The derived
class should use the LoadTestingSession object to simulate page requests.

testServerScripts
This folder contains PHP files and bash scripts that will be run on the test
server.  Some of the base classes above are copied by the load testing script.
